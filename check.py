Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines in scoring and ranking a documentâ€™s relevance given a query. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus (data-set)."
